## Overview

This project is a fully functional multi-vendor eCommerce platform developed using Laravel, MySQL, and Bootstrap. It enables multiple vendors to sell their products through a shared online marketplace while maintaining individual control over their stores. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and user-friendly for both vendors and customers.

## Key Features

- **Vendor Management**: Vendors can register and manage their own stores, including products, orders, and profiles from a dedicated vendor dashboard.

- **Customer Interface**: Customers can browse products across all vendors, create accounts, add items to a cart, and place orders securely.

- **Product Catalog**: Each vendor can add, edit, and delete products, upload images, manage stock levels, and set pricing.

- **Order Processing**: Customers can check out with a seamless order process, while vendors can track and manage their received orders.

- **Admin Dashboard**: The administrator can manage vendor approvals, monitor system activity, manage categories, and oversee user roles and permissions.

- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap, the frontend is responsive and provides a smooth experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: For building a robust and maintainable back-end with MVC architecture and RESTful APIs.

- **Bootstrap**: For creating responsive and consistent front-end interfaces with pre-designed components.

- **MySQL**: For managing relational data and handling complex queries efficiently.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included structuring vendor-specific access controls, managing relational data efficiently across users and vendors, and maintaining UX consistency across different user roles. Working with Laravel's Eloquent ORM made complex data relationships easier to manage, and Bootstrap accelerated frontend development without sacrificing design quality.

## Outcome

This system successfully streamlines eCommerce operations for a multi-vendor model. It supports independent vendor operations under a shared platform while ensuring a smooth shopping experience for customers. The use of Laravel and MySQL ensures maintainability and scalability, while Bootstrap ensures a modern and responsive UI.
