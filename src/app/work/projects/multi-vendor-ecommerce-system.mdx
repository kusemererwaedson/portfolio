## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Code Generation**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: For building a robust and maintainable back-end with MVC architecture and RESTful APIs.

- **Bootstrap**: For creating responsive and consistent front-end interfaces with pre-designed components.

- **MySQL**: For managing relational data and handling complex queries efficiently.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included structuring vendor-specific access controls, managing relational data efficiently across users and vendors, and maintaining UX consistency across different user roles. Working with Laravel's Eloquent ORM made complex data relationships easier to manage, and Bootstrap accelerated frontend development without sacrificing design quality.

## Outcome

This system successfully streamlines eCommerce operations for a multi-vendor model. It supports independent vendor operations under a shared platform while ensuring a smooth shopping experience for customers. The use of Laravel and MySQL ensures maintainability and scalability, while Bootstrap ensures a modern and responsive UI.
